**Welcome to my website!**

I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Uppsala Univeristy, studying the impact of AI and algorithmic decision making in the labor market. 

**Caseworker-Algorithm Collaboration in Predicting Jobseeker Success [JMP] **
As predictive algorithms become increasingly integrated into public policy, understanding their interaction with human decision-makers is essential. While many things speak in favor of machines outperforming humans, the determinants of successful human-algorithm collaboration remain less explored. I study the use of an algorithmic prediction of jobseekers' reemployment probability at the Swedish Public Employment Service, designed to assist caseworkers in labor market assessments and better target job search assistance to those with the greatest needs. By exploiting random assignment of jobseekers to caseworkers and variation in caseworker propensity to assign jobseekers to independent job search, I reconstruct the algorithmic counterfactual allocation of jobseekers and estimate employment outcomes under strict adherence to the algorithm.

**Major adjustments? How graduates from high school and college adjust to changes in labor demand** 
Joint with Georg Graetz, Uppsala University, and Oskar Nordström Skans, Uppsala University.  

We analyse how entry occupations, earnings, and educational fields at high school and
college respond to gradual changes in occupation-specific labor demand. Using detailed
register data from Sweden, we show that recent graduates’ occupational choices are more
narrow than those of mature workers. Despite of this, their occupational choices are at least
as responsive to changes in labor demand as those of mature workers. At the same time,
graduates are resilient—they do not suffer from detectable earnings losses due to declining
labor demand in the occupations that are most closely associated with their field of study.
Moreover, we find no systematic relationship between a fields’ exposure to occupational
demand shifts and changes in their popularity. Overall, we conclude that Swedish graduates’
skills are sufficiently general to facilitate adjustments to structural change without altered
field compositions, despite the prevalence of specialized high school and college educations,
and strong occupational concentrations within these specializations.


**Transparency, governance, and water and sanitation: Experimental evidence from schools in rural Bangladesh**
Joint with Umrbek Allakulov, Serena Cocciolo, Binayak Das, Md. Ahasan Habib, and Anna Tompsett. []

Can transparency interventions improve WASH service provision? We use a randomized experiment to evaluate the impacts of a transparency intervention, a deliberative multi-stakeholder workshop initiated with a community scorecard exercise, in schools in rural Bangladesh. To measure impacts, we combine survey data, direct observations, and administrative data. The intervention leads to moderate but consistent improvements in knowledge of WASH standards and practices, and institutions for WASH service management, but does not improve school WASH service provision or change WASH facility use patterns. Drawing on rich descriptive data, we suggest several reasons why the intervention we evaluate did not improve WASH service outcomes and propose ways to improve the design of future interventions.
